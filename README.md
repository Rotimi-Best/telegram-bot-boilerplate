This a my custom boiler plate for building any kind of telegram bot.


# Why telegram?
**IMO Telegram is the best messaging platform in the world** and I love building bots for such a wonderful platform. One major thing I love about Telegram is that they don't keep their users in a box, there is so much flexibily while using the app that you just don't want to leave it alone.

Thanks to the Telegram team for the hard work.

I love making bots that solves my day to day problems and telegram just had all it took to help me achieve this.
